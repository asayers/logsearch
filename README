logsearch(1)                General Commands Manual               logsearch(1)

NAME
       logsearch - Search a log file for the first occurance of a value

SYNOPSIS
       logsearch [OPTIONS] <FILE>

DESCRIPTION
       logsearch  takes  a  log-formatted  file  (see  "Log format" below) and
       searches for a particular message. If the target message is found,  the
       byte-offset of that message within the log file is returned.

       A  log  file  is  a  concatenated sequence of messages. In its simplest
       invokation, logsearch allows the user to search for a  message  by  its
       sequence number.

       Messages  in a log file may also have one or more monotonically growing
       integer fields associated with them. In this case, logsearch can search
       for a message by the value of one of its fields.

OPTIONS
       -f, --field=<number>
              Search  for  a message by the specified field. If this option is
              omitted, the target will  be  taken  to  refer  to  a  message's
              sequence number.

       -t, --target=<value>
              Search  for  a  message  which matches the specified value. This
              value is either matches against a field, or the sequence numbers
              of the messages. If no target is specified, we simply update the
              index and exit.

       --index-file=<path>
              Where to cache the index. If this option is  not  specified,  an
              index  file will be created next to the log file, named the same
              way but including a ".idx" extension.

       -v     Make logsearch more verbose. May be given multiple times.

DISCUSSION
   Log format
       A log file is a concatenation of length-prefixed blobs. Message  fields
       are  expected  immediately  follow  the length tag, although they don't
       have to. The message format is as follows:

           [length | field 0 | field 1 | ... | message data ]

       The length, as well  as  all  of  the  fields,  are  big-endian  64-bit
       unsigned  integers.  The  length tag specifies the length of the entire
       message, including the 8 bytes taken by the length tag itself.

       In order for a field to be searchable, the user  must  ensure  that  it
       increases monotonically through the log file. Non-monotonic fields will
       not be detected at search time - logsearch will simply return the  off‚Äê
       set of some message.

   Index files
       When  searching  a  log file, logsearch first creates an index which is
       caches in a file. The name of the index file is the  same  as  the  log
       file  being  searched, with a ".idx" extension added. These index files
       are purely for speeding up future searches in the same log, and can  be
       safely  deleted.   However, note that when a log file is very large and
       not in the OS page cache, the existence of an  index  file  may  become
       important for reasonable performance.

EXAMPLES
       Tailing a remote log file, starting at a particular message:

           ssh logserver -- tail --bytes=+$(logsearch -t 1000) --follow

                                                                  logsearch(1)
